When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

For portability and sharing-for-collaboration purposes. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

To avoid pushing changes which are not fully tested yet.
